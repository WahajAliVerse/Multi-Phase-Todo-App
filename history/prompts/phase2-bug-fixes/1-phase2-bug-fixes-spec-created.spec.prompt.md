# Phase 2 Bug Fixes Specification Created

## Summary

Created a comprehensive feature specification for Phase 2 of the Full-Stack Todo App, focusing on bug fixes and enhancements. The specification addresses all the critical issues mentioned in the user requirements.

## Details

- Generated feature branch `001-phase2-bug-fixes`
- Created detailed specification document with user scenarios, requirements, and success criteria
- Identified four main user stories with priorities:
  1. Bug-Free Authentication and Authorization (P1)
  2. Modern, Responsive UI Experience (P1)
  3. Reliable Task Management with Advanced Features (P2)
  4. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Functionality (P2)
- Defined 13 functional requirements covering authentication, UI, task management, security, and performance
- Established 13 measurable success criteria for the feature
- Created quality checklist to validate the specification

## Outcome

The specification is ready for the next phase of development planning. All quality criteria have been met, and there are no remaining clarifications needed. The feature is well-defined with clear acceptance criteria and measurable outcomes that align with the constitution requirements (95% test coverage, <500ms responses).
