## Response Text

```
Based on your request to modernize the front-end UI to make it less cluttered with a unique, modern design for 2026, including light/dark themes while keeping the logic unchanged, I've clarified the following requirements in the specification:

1. Modern UI with light/dark themes and de-cluttered design for 2026
2. Automatic system preference detection for theme selection
3. Minimal design elements with appropriate white space to reduce UI clutter
4. Maintaining all existing functionality while updating the UI layer only
5. Following modern UI/UX best practices for 2026

These requirements have been added to the functional requirements (FR-016 to FR-020), user stories (new User Story 1), and success criteria (SC-009 to SC-012) sections of the specification.

The specification now clearly defines the UI/UX requirements while ensuring that all existing functionality remains unchanged.
