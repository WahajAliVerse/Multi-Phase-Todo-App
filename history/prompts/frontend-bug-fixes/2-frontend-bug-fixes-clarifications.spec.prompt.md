# Frontend Bug Fixes Clarifications

## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

Clarification session completed for frontend bug fixes specification. Five key questions were asked and answered to refine the specification:

1. CORS configuration details for development environments (localhost:3000-3003)
2. Performance expectations (API responses under 200ms for 95% of requests)
3. Browser/device support (all modern browsers and mobile browsers)
4. Error handling approach (user-friendly messages with retry options)
5. UI color contrast requirements (WCAG AA standards - 4.5:1 ratio)

The specification was updated with these clarifications, adding new functional requirements, success criteria, and refining user stories and acceptance scenarios.

## Outcome

Specification now includes detailed requirements for CORS configuration, performance targets, browser compatibility, error handling, and UI contrast improvements. Ready for planning phase.
